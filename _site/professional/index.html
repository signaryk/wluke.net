    <h1 id="professional-interests">Professional Interests</h1>
<p>As I conclude my university studies, I would like to apply what I have learned to working with projects
involving concurrent data processing and computer networking, preferably in a Linux or BSD environment.
I am also very interested in working with cloud infrastructure, HPC clusters, or on-premises server
infrastructure, having taken a great interest to the way these work during my employment with College of
Engineering IT and Texas A&amp;M University.</p>

<h1 id="strengths-and-skills">Strengths and Skills</h1>
<p>I am very flexible in what environments I am comfortable programming in, be it a different language, build
system, or VCS. While I consider myself to be proficient in C++ and Go, I also have experience with several
other programming languages. When faced with an unfamiliar concept I like to take the time to understand
what is the goal of what I am trying to do, what is the best way of approaching/accomplishing the given task,
and understanding what it is I am doing before deploying a solution to production. Since I have never been 
focused on only solving problems in one way, and take the time to see if there are better ways of approaching
a problem, I believe I can adapt well to new challenges and environments in due time.</p>
