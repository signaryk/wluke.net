# Service
In the past I was a volunteer Taekwondo instructor at my academy, helping the full-time Instructors pass on
what I had learned in an activity I loved to newer groups of martial artists. 

I am a regular volunteer in Texas A&M University's annual [Big Event](https://bigevent.tamu.edu/) community 
service project.

Currently I am working on open-source projects, such as maintaining Linux distributions on different platforms,
in order to give back to a community that has so strongly nurtured my love of computers.
